Static Import  - 

Import code that has been exported by another module
A statically imported module is a module that's imported with the default import keyword.

import module1 from "./module1";
import module2 from "./module2";
import module3 from "./module3";
In this case, module1, module2, and module3 are statically imported.

Pros - 
Loading instant dependencies: Statically imported components are instantly available to the user
Optimizations: Statically imported modules can be statically analyzed and tree-shaken.

Cons - 
Large bundle size: When importing all modules, you might include code that won't be necessary
