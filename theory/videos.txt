  Loading Performance - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
  Input Responsiveness - FID (First Input Delay)
  Visual Stability - CLS (Cummulative Layout Shift)

  FCP occurs before LCP which occurs before FID. As such, resources required for achieving FCP 
  should be prioritized over those required by LCP followed by those required by FID.

  a) By the time FCP fires, the hero image should be available for firing LCP.
  b) By the time LCP fires, the JavaScript (JS) should be downloaded, parsed and 
     ready (or already executing) to unblock interaction (FID).



6) Improved Web Vitals metrics of the website for better experience and performance.
