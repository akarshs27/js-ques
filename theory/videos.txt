Web Vitals ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NItNEiWmJdU )
  Loading Performance - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
  Input Responsiveness - FID (First Input Delay)
  Visual Stability - CLS (Cummulative Layout Shift)

  FCP occurs before LCP which occurs before FID. As such, resources required for achieving FCP 
  should be prioritized over those required by LCP followed by those required by FID.

  a) By the time FCP fires, the hero image should be available for firing LCP.
  b) By the time LCP fires, the JavaScript (JS) should be downloaded, parsed and 
     ready (or already executing) to unblock interaction (FID).



6) Improved Web Vitals metrics of the website for better experience and performance.

// You have a nested object which can have primitive types, arrays(with any type of value). You have to write a function:
// To return whether a target value exists in object as value
// To return the depth/level at which this value exists.
// To return an array of paths which needs to be traversed to get this target value.
// Note: path can be key or an index

// Sample Input:
// Output:
// {
// exists: true,
// level: 3,
// path: [key2, key4, 3]
// }

// Input Target value: ‘X’
// Input Object:
// {
// key1: 'value1',
// key2: {
// key3: 'value2',
// key4: [1, 2, 3, 'X'],
// },
// }
